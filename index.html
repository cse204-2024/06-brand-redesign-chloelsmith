            <!-- want to make the header look more like the header on General Dynamics website. Specifically including 
            stock price in the heading next to the investors and suppliers as an attention getter 
            so like a 2 layered header and the search bar below I think also looks better  -->

                what we do section should come first: 
                "Delivering solutions to the world toughest challenges since 1995"
                learn more button 
                domain capabilities in a tabel should also go here I think
